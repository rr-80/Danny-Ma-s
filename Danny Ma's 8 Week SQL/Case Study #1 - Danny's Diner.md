**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**
````sql
WITH OrderedPurchase AS (
select s.customer_id, m.product_name, row_number()over(partition by s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date) as ordered
from sales as s
INNER JOIN menu as m
on s.product_id = m.product_id
)
Select customer_id, product_name
from OrderedPurchase
where ordered = 1;
````

From my understanding, the first item that was purchased can only be one, however the first order could me multiple items. Hence, I am listing only the first.
