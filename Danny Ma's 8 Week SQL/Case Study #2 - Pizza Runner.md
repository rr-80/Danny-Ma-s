## Business Task
Danny is expanding his new Pizza Empire and at the same time, he wants to Uberize it, so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

## Data Cleaning: 
### Table: customer_orders
Looking at the customer_orders table below, we can see that there are:

In the exclusions column, there are missing/ blank spaces ' ' and null values.
In the extras column, there are missing/ blank spaces ' ' and null values.
I am cleaning them using a TEMPORARY Table.

````sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE customer_order_temp (
    order_id INT,
    customer_id INT,
    pizza_id INT,
    exclusions VARCHAR(255),
    extras VARCHAR(255),
    order_time DATETIME
) AS
SELECT
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    pizza_id,
    COALESCE(exclusions, '') as exclusions,
    COALESCE(extras, '') as extras,
    order_time
FROM customer_orders;
````

    COALESCE(TRIM(REGEXP_REPLACE(duration, '(minutes|minute|min|mins|s)', ' ')),' ') AS duration,
    COALESCE(cancellation, '') as cancellation
FROM runner_orders;
